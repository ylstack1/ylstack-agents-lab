/**
 * A `Workspace`-shaped proxy that forwards every method call to the parent
 * `DownyAgent` over DO-to-DO RPC. Lets `ChildAgent` register the same
 * workspace-backed tools as the parent (skill writes, file read/write/edit/
 * delete, glob) without keeping a second authoritative copy of the workspace
 * inside the child DO.
 *
 * Built as a runtime `Proxy` rather than a hand-written class so it covers
 * the full Workspace public surface (~22 methods) without 22 boilerplate
 * forwarders. The parent enforces the allowlist on its side
 * (`ALLOWED_WORKSPACE_METHODS` in DownyAgent.ts) — the proxy itself does
 * not gate calls.
 *
 * Cast to `Workspace` is structural (Proxy intercepts every method); we mark
 * it `as unknown as Workspace` because the Proxy target is `{}` and TS can't
 * see through that.
